Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids.

They live to be around 80.', 'Alignment': ' Dragonborn tend towards extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other between Good and Evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). More side with Bahamut than Tiamat (whose non-dragon followers are mostly kobolds), but villainous dragonborn can be quite terrible indeed. Some rare few choose to devote themselves to lesser dragon deities, such as Chronepsis (Neutral), and fewer still choose to worship Io, the Ninefold Dragon, who is all alignments at once.', 'Size': ' Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds.

They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.', 'Alignment': ' Dragonborn tend towards extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other between Good and Evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). More side with Bahamut than Tiamat (whose non-dragon followers are mostly kobolds), but villainous dragonborn can be quite terrible indeed. Some rare few choose to devote themselves to lesser dragon deities, such as Chronepsis (Neutral), and fewer still choose to worship Io, the Ninefold Dragon, who is all alignments at once.', 'Size': ' Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds.

This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.\nFire Starter. The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.\nMusic Box. When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed.\nAt your DM's discretion, you may make other objects with effects similar in power to these. The Prestidigitation cantrip is a good baseline for such effects.\n\n"}}, 'Eberron: Rising from the Last War': {'Mark of Scribing': {'Description': "If you're a gnome with the Mark of Scribing, you have this subrace, with the following traits.", 'Ability Score Increase': ' Your Charisma score increases by 1', 'Gifted Scribe': " Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) or an Ability Check involving Calligrapher's Supplies, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the total ability check.", "Scribe's Insight": " You know the Message cantrip.

Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury.', 'Ability Score Increase': ' Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.', 'Age': ' Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.', 'Alignment': ' Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc parents and are not strongly inclined toward good. Half-orcs raised among orcs and willing to live out their lives among them are usually evil.', 'Size': ' Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.', 'Speed': ' Your base walking speed is 30 feet.', 'Darkvision': " Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.", 'Menacing': ' You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.', 'Relentless Endurance': " When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.", 'Savage Attacks': " When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.", 'Languages': ' You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc. Orc is a harsh, grating language with hard consonants. It has no script of its own but is written in the Dwarvish script.'}}, 'Eberron: Rising from the Last War': {'Half-Orc': {}, 'Mark of Finding': {'Description': "If your Half-Orc has the Mark of Finding, replace all Racial Traits found in the Player's Handbook with these, except for Age, Alignment, Size, and Speed.", 'Ability Score Increase': ' Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.', 'Darkvision': " You can see in dim light within 60ft. of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

Starting at 3rd level, you can also cast the Locate Object spell with it. Once you cast either spell with this trait, you can't cast that spell again until you finish a Long Rest. Wisdom is your Spellcasting Ability for these spells.", 'Languages': ' You can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin.', 'Spells of the Mark': ' If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Finding Spells table are added to the spell list of your Spellcasting class.'}}}

They resemble elves but have goatlike legs, cloven hooves, and ram or goat horns. The magic of the fey realm has given them an innate ability to perform, to delight, and to resist magical intrusion. While they’re usually found in the Feywild, satyrs do wander to other planes of existence, most often to the Material Plane. There they seek to bring a bit of their home plane’s splendor to other worlds.', 'Ability Score Increase': " When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.", 'Creature Type': ' You are a Fey.', 'Size': ' You are Medium.', 'Speed': ' Your walking speed is 35 feet.', 'Ram': ' You can use your head and horns to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.', 'Magic Resistance': ' You have advantage on saving throws against spells.', 'Mirthful Leaps': ' Whenever you make a long jump or a high jump, you can roll a d8 and add the number rolled to the number of feet you cover, even when making a standing jump. This extra distance costs movement as normal.', 'Reveler': ' As an embodiment of revelry, you have proficiency in the Performance and Persuasion skills, and you have proficiency with one musical instrument of your choice.', 'Languages': ' Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player’s Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.'}}, 'Mythic Odysseys of Theros': {'Satyr': {}}}

Over the centuries, some of them have continued to serve her, while others have ventured into the Material Plane to forge their own destinies.', 'Ability Score Increase': " When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.", 'Creature Type': ' You are a Humanoid. You are also considered an elf for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be an elf.', 'Size': ' You are Medium.', 'Speed': ' Your walking speed is 30 feet.', 'Blessing of the Raven Queen': ' As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\nStarting at 3rd level, you also gain resistance to all damage when you teleport using this trait. The resistance lasts until the start of your next turn. During that time, you appear ghostly and translucent.\n\n', 'Darkvision': ' You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.', 'Fey Ancestry': ' You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself.', 'Keen Senses': ' You have proficiency in the Perception skill.', 'Necrotic Resistance': ' You have resistance to necrotic damage.', 'Trance': ' You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which you retain consciousness.\n\nWhenever you finish this trance, you can gain two proficiencies that you don’t have, each one with a weapon or a tool of your choice selected from the Player’s Handbook. You mystically acquire these proficiencies by drawing them from shared elven memory, and you retain them until you finish your next long rest.\n\n', 'Languages': ' Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player’s Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.'}}, "Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes": {'Shadar-Kai': {}}}

The centaurs of Theros are divided into two groups: members of the far-traveling Lagonna band and the proud raiders of the Pheres band. These bands occupy territories situated between the three major human poleis, making them common sights to those who travel human lands. Not ones to settle in permanent homes, though, centaurs might be found wherever there are wonders to be witnessed and adventures to be had."}}}

Long before the god Maglubiyet conquered them, early goblins served in the court of the Queen of Air and Darkness, one of the Feywild’s archfey. Goblins thrived in her dangerous domain thanks to a special boon from her—a supernatural knack for finding the weak spots in foes larger than themselves and for getting out of trouble.

In some lands, kobolds serve chromatic or metallic dragons — even worshiping them as divine beings. In other places, kobolds know too well how dangerous those dragons can be and help others defend against draconic destruction.', 'Ability Score Increase': " When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.", 'Creature Type': ' You are a Humanoid.', 'Size': ' You are Small.', 'Speed': ' Your walking speed is 30 feet.', 'Darkvision': ' You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.', 'Draconic Cry': ' As a bonus action, you let out a cry at your enemies within 10 feet of you. Until the start of your next turn, you and your allies have advantage on attack rolls against any of those enemies who could hear you. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.', 'Kobold Legacy': ' Kobolds’ connection to dragons can manifest in unpredictable ways in an individual kobold. Choose one of the following legacy options for your kobold:\n\nCraftiness. You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, Investigation, Medicine, Sleight of Hand, or Survival.\nDefiance. You have advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the frightened condition on yourself.\nDraconic Sorcery. You know one cantrip of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for that cantrip (choose when you select this race).\n\n', 'Languages': ' Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player’s Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.'}}, "Volo's Guide to Monsters": {'Kobold': {'Description': 'Kobolds are often dismissed as cowardly, foolish, and weak, but these little reptilian creatures actually have a strong social structure that stresses devotion to the tribe, are clever with their hands, and viciously work together in order to overcome their physical limitations.', 'Ability Score Increase': ' Your Dexterity score increases by 2.', 'Age': ' Kobolds reach adulthood at age 6 and can live up to 120 years but rarely do so.', 'Alignment': ' Kobolds are fundamentally selfish, making them evil, but their reliance on the strength of their group makes them trend toward law.', 'Size': ' Kobolds are between 2 and 3 feet tall and weigh between 25 and 35 pounds.

The patterns on their skin suggest the colors of the tree frogs common in the rain forest, as do their eyes of orange, lime green, or sky blue. Their fins are relatively short and thick. They climb trees with ease, move through undergrowth unhindered, and often wield magic to shape vines and branches to their will.\nAbility Score Increase.

Their eyes are red, orange, or blue, and their long, thin, and elegant fins resemble scarves or veils of fine fabric. They swim easily, even upstream, and clamber over rocks and through rapids with ease. They prefer to dwell in shallow waters, but spend a fair amount of time on land as well.\nAbility Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 2.\nLore of the Waters. You gain proficiency in History and Nature.\nCantrip. You know one cantrip of your choice from the Wizard spell list.

In the past, merfolk society was organized around their belief in three deities. But in the wake of the reappearance of the Eldrazi, the merfolk have realized that their faith was a web of lies, built on a corrupted memory of the Eldrazi titans handed down from generation to generation. In peaceful times, the merfolk might have fought over the ultimate meaning of this revelation. But faced with the danger presented by the Eldrazi broods, the merfolk have largely set aside their differences and joined together in a united force. Old grudges still linger, but the well-being of the merfolk race—and the world—far outweigh any ancient conflicts between creeds.'}}}

They settle on rocky coasts and remote islands, and even on floating piles of kelp. Sirens are mercurial creatures who can turn in an instant from lonely to repulsed, from desirous to hateful, from welcoming to irritated, from loving to murderous—and then back again. They are fascinated with ships, and enjoy toying with them. One siren might call out to a passing crew for company, only to capriciously draw the ship into an entangling mass of kelp. Another might lure a vessel onto jagged rocks so as to study the wreckage and learn more about the strange contraption. But as the number of Brazen Coalition ships passing through siren-controlled waters has increased over the years, a growing number of sirens have decided to satisfy their curiosity by taking positions on ship crews—including, in at least one case, the position of captain.'}}}
