The item you infuse serves as the creature's heart, around which the creature's body instantly forms.\nYou determine the homunculus's appearance. Some artificers prefer mechanical-looking birds, whereas some like winged vials or miniature, animate cauldrons.\nThe homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the Homunculus Servant stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.\nIn combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.\nThe homunculus regains 2d6 hit points if the mending spell is cast on it. If you or the homunculus dies, it vanishes, leaving its heart in its space.\n\n\nHomunculus Servant\n\n\nTiny construct\n\n\nArmor Class: 13 (natural armor)\n\n\nHit Points: 1 + your Intelligence modifier + your artificer level (the homunculus has a number of Hit Dice [d4s] equal to your artificer level)\n\n\nSpeed: 20 ft., fly 30 ft.\n\n\nSTR\nDEX\nCON\nINT\nWIS\nCHA\n\n\n4 (-3)\n15 (+2)\n12 (+1)\n10 (+0)\n10 (+0)\n7 (\u22122)\n\n\nSaving Throws: Dex +2 plus PB\n\n\nSkills: Perception +0 plus PB x 2, Stealth +2 plus PB\n\n\nDamage Immunities: poison\n\n\nCondition Immunities: exhaustion, poisoned\n\n\nSenses: darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10 + (PB x 2)\n\n\nLanguages: understands the languages you speak\n\n\nChallenge: \u2014\n\n\nProficiency Bonus (PB): equals your bonus\n\n\nEvasion. If the homunculus is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. It can't use this trait if it's incapacitated.\n\n\nActions\n\n\nForce Strike. Ranged Weapon Attack: your spell attack modifier to hit, range 30 ft., one target you can see.

The weapon regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.\nRepeating Shot\nItem: A simple or martial weapon with the ammunition property (requires attunement)\nThis magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it when it's used to make a ranged attack, and it ignores the loading property if it has it.\nIf the weapon lacks ammunition, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of magic ammunition when the wielder makes a ranged attack with it. The ammunition created by the weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.\nReplicate Magic Item\nUsing this infusion, you replicate a particular magic item. You can learn this infusion multiple times; each time you do so, choose a magic item that you can make with it, picking from the Replicable Items tables. A table's title tells you the level you must be in the class to choose an item from the table. Alternatively, you can choose the magic item from among the common magic items in the game, not including potions or scrolls.\nIn the tables, an item's entry tells you whether the item requires attunement. See the item's description in the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information about it, including the type of object required for its making.\nIf you have Xanathar's Guide to Everything, you can choose from among the common magic items in that book when you pick a magic item you can replicate with this infusion.\n\n\nReplicable Magic Items (2nd-Level Artificer)\n\n\nMagic Item\nAttunement\n\n\nAlchemy Jug\nNo\n\n\nBag of Holding\nNo\n\n\nCap of Water Breathing\nNo\n\n\nGoggles of Night\nNo\n\n\nRope of Climbing\nNo\n\n\nSending Stones\nNo\n\n\nWand of Magic Detection\nNo\n\n\nWand of Secrets\nNo\n\n\n\n\nReplicable Magic Items (6th-Level Artificer)\n\n\nMagic Item\nAttunement\n\n\nBoots of Elvenkind\nNo\n\n\nCloak of Elvenkind\nYes\n\n\nCloak of the Manta Ray\nNo\n\n\nEyes of Charming\nYes\n\n\nGloves of Thievery\nNo\n\n\nLantern of Revealing\nNo\n\n\nPipes of Haunting\nNo\n\n\nRing of Water Walking\nNo\n\n\n\n\nReplicable Magic Items (10th-level artificer)\n\n\nMagic Item\nAttunement\n\n\nBoots of Striding and Springing\nYes\n\n\nBoots of the Winterlands\nYes\n\n\nBracers of Archery\nYes\n\n\nBrooch of Shielding\nYes\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nYes\n\n\nEyes of the Eagle\nYes\n\n\nGauntlets of Ogre Power\nYes\n\n\nGloves of Missile Snaring\nYes\n\n\nGloves of Swimming and Climbing\nYes\n\n\nHat of Disguise\nYes\n\n\nHeadband of Intellect\nYes\n\n\nHelm of Telepathy\nYes\n\n\nMedallion of Thoughts\nYes\n\n\nNecklace of Adaptation\nYes\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nYes\n\n\nPipes of the Sewers\nYes\n\n\nQuiver of Ehlonna\nNo\n\n\nRing of Jumping\nYes\n\n\nRing of Mind Shielding\nYes\n\n\nSlippers of Spider Climbing\nYes\n\n\nVentilating Lungs (Eberron: Rising from the Last War)\nYes\n\n\nWinged Boots\nYes\n\n\n\n\nReplicable Magic Items (14th-level artificer)\n\n\nMagic Item\nAttunement\n\n\nAmulet of Health\nYes\n\n\nArcane Propulsion Arm (Eberron: Rising from the Last War)\nYes\n\n\nBelt of Hill Giant Strength\nYes\n\n\nBoots of Levitation\nYes\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nYes\n\n\nBracers of Defense\nYes\n\n\nCloak of the Bat\nYes\n\n\nDimensional Shackles\nNo\n\n\nGem of Seeing\nYes\n\n\nHorn of Blasting\nNo\n\n\nRing of Free Action\nYes\n\n\nRing of Protection\nYes\n\n\nRing of the Ram\nYes\n\n\nRepulsion Shield\nPrerequisite: 6th-level artificer\nItem: A shield (requires attunement)\nA creature gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class while wielding this shield.\nThe shield has 4 charges.
