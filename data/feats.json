You gain the following benefits:\nIncrease your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\nYou learn a cantrip of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. In addition, choose a 1st-level spell from the sorcerer spell list. You learn that spell and can cast it through your mark. Once you cast it, you must finish a short or long rest before you can cast it again through the mark. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.\nWhen you cast the 1st-level spell through your mark, you can expend one of your Hit Dice and roll it. If you roll an even number, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the number rolled. If you roll an odd number, one random creature within 30 feet of you (not including you) takes force damage equal to the number rolled. If no other creatures are in range, you take the damage.\nYou also develop a random flaw from the Aberrant Dragonmark Flaws table.Option: Greater Aberrant Powers\nAt the DM's option, a character who has the Aberrant Dragonmark feat has a chance of manifesting greater power. Upon reaching 10th level, such a character has a 10 percent chance of gaining an epic boon from among the options in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. If the character fails to gain a boon, they have a 10 percent chance the next time they gain a level.\nIf the character gains a boon, the DM chooses it or determines it randomly. The character also permanently loses one of their Hit Dice, and their hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to a roll of that die plus their Constitution modifier (minimum reduction of 1). This reduction can't be reversed by any means.\n",

Your experience with portals allows you to open them without a portal key. As an action, you can concentrate on a portal you're aware of within 5 feet of yourself and make a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a failed check, you take 3d8 psychic damage and can't use this benefit on that portal again until you finish a long rest. On a successful check, you can force the portal open or closed for 1 hour. For that duration, the portal doesn't respond to its portal key unless a creature employing the key succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check as an action.Portal Sense. You know the direction to the last planar portal you used while you and the portal are on the same plane of existence. Moreover, as an action, you can detect the location of any portals within 30 feet of you that aren't behind total cover. Once you detect a portal with this action, you can't use the action again until you finish a long rest."
